	We have over 180 children who use 1st Place (our Scout Hut) every week in term-time.  Our Beavers, Cubs and Scouts enjoy a varied programme of adventurous activities in a safe and fun environment.  1st Place is in Harestock.  Most of our Young People live in the Harestock & Weeke areas.  We do have some girls and boys from further afield.  The Scout Hut was rebuilt in 2014 to maximise enjoyment and safety for our Beavers, Cubs and Scouts.  It is also available for community users.<br>
	<br>
	Adults have fun too!  Join as one of our Leaders.  Help out some evenings, or support the admin behind the scenes.  There is plenty to do!  With so many Young People, we have a constant need for new leaders and helpers.  With plenty of experienced leaders we pass on the knowledge to new adult helpers.  In addition to weekly term-time meetings, we have a full programme of camps - from sleepovers, to weeks-away camping in great parts of the UK.  If you wish your children to have a fantastic adventure in scouting and you’d like to join in, do volunteer!<br>

	Our Special Educational Needs (SEN) Cub Pack and Scout Troop are mainly for the young people of the two schools, many of whom come from beyond Winchester.  With the agreement of the schools and the Group Scout Leader, both sections are also open to membership by young people with SEN from across the Winchester area.<br>
	<br>
	Scouting has always been an inclusive movement for young people.  We achieve
	inclusivity through the adoption of the 'reasonable adjustment' principle.  You can
	find out more about this by clicking on <i>Inclusivity & SEN</i> at the bottom of the left hand vertical menu bar opposite.<br>
	<br>
	As for all scout parents, we ask that you agree to undertake some adult role.  Many hands make light work!  This is how we provide the very best for our young people.  We are a voluntary organisation and need parents, friend and teachers to volunteer for uniform leader, non-uniform charity trustee (Group Exec) and Activity Instructor roles.  You can see the various roles under the ADULT TEAM LEADER and POSITIONS VACANT icons opposite.  In some Groups there are over 150 such roles.  Everyone has something to offer!<br>
	<br>
	Right now, we occupy the warm nest of the 1st Winchester (Weeke & Harestock) Scout Group.  We do this as 'satellite sections' whilst we develop our capabilities and strength as an adult team.  In due course we need to fly their nest and be a Scout Group in our own right.  This is how we will provide the very best Scouting possible for our young people.  Please help and agree to be a ><i>flexible volunteer</i>.  Just hit the CONTACT US icon if you would like to help in some way.  You could be a parent, and existing leader or an Explorer Young Leader.  We would like to hear from all of you!<br>

	Our lively group with a long and successful history is based in its own HQ. With Beaver Scouts, Cub Scouts and Scouts making up the group with leaders and non-uniform supporters, it is a testimony to scouting being a part of the local community.<br>
	<br>
	The group welcomes girls and boys and enjoys taking part in local events as well as making regular contributions to district events where the youngsters get the opportunity to meet up with other scouts around the Winchester area. They also make every effort to take advantage of events organised further afield making them a truly "all round" group giving their scouts a balanced programme of fun, activity and challenge.<br>
	<br>
	The group is always ready to welcome new members, especially adults and the above link will help you to find out more the group.<br>

	Parental involvement is the critical factor affecting the growth of the 4th.  This affects the number of places we can offer in Cubs for 8 - 10.5 year olds. If we had more parents willing to join the fun and become Assistant Leaders, we could offer places in Cubs and Scouts for many more boys. <br>
	<br>
	The 4th needs more parent leaders on a 'flexible volunteering' or every other week basis.  This is to help share the load and to provide flexibility given our busy parent lives.  This is fun, easy and very rewarding for us as adults.  Scouting is all about 'learning by doing' to help young people reach their full potential through exciting and adventurous activities that follow the national Scout Programme.<br>
	<br>
	The 4th Winchester dates from 1913 as the Quiristers' Troop. The 4th ran continuously in Winchester College and then in The Pilgrims' School until 1991 when it closed. It reopened again in 2015.  It is now a Sponsored Group under POR Rule 3.14 for the boys of The Pilgrims' School.<br>

	The flourishing 5th Winchester Scout Group is at the heart of the local community in Compton and Shawford. Our Reeves Hall hut is used almost 24/7 by all of pre-school, local clubs, the Parish Council - and our Scouts!  Many of our young people come from Compton Primary School where we play a full part in school fetes and at All Saints Parish Church next door. <br>
	<br>
	Our young people have such a great time that we have near 100% 'moving on' rates from Beavers to Cubs; Cubs to Scouts and Scouts to Explorers. We do all sorts of adventurous things like camping, canoeing, hill walking, climbing and abseiling, caving, mountain biking. Every year we are big on nights away and expeditions be it canoeing down the Wye River valley, or basing ourselves in a Snowdonian mountain hut to walk the Glyders and rock climb. We have great fun!<br>
	<br>
	We have been so successful that we have outgrown our small 1960s hall.  We now need to find a suitable plot of land on which we can build a new Scout building for our local community for the 21st Century. 5th Winchester Scouts NEED YOU! Do come and JOIN US as a parent volunteer! We have a clever system of 'flexible volunteering' to make this possible. The busier you are, the more we need you!<br>

	Our Group was established from scratch in January 2014 to ensure Scout places for our children.  We have grown rapidly since then.  Many of our Scouts live within Abbotts Barton and Hyde; however, we have members from a whole variety of schools and locations in Winchester.  We meet at Holy Trinity Church Hall, Upper Brook Street but like to get out and about whenever we can, visiting local places of interest, hiking, den-building, climbing, canoeing and camping. We often participate in District Activities and competitions such as Archery, Rifle Shooting, Crate Stacking and Athletics to name but a few.<br>
	<br>
	We like to think of Scouting as a whole family activity. Our parents must agree to play some part in our Scout community.  Our Assistant Leaders and Section Assistants are mostly parent volunteers.  We all have busy lives.  But we have found success in flexible volunteering whereby 5-6 leaders share the planning and delivery of the terms program organising 2-3 sessions per term with the benefit of various pre-planned activities available.  Full support and training is provided.<br>
	<br>
	To ensure our long-term future we are half way through a £750k <a href="https://m.box.com/shared_item/https%3A%2F%2Fapp.box.com%2Fs%2Fpum9n8fu7w3ww6pxoapmbkni5uto4cmp" target="_blank">new site and building project in Hillier Way</a>. This will give us a permanent home for the next 100 years at the centre of our local community. This is a huge voluntary effort helped by Winchester City Council.  Outside meeting hours this will also be for community use. <br>

	The 7th Winchester Scout Group was resurrected in 2012.  It has a thriving Beaver Colony, Cub Pack and Scout Troop serving St Cross and the surrounding areas of Winchester.<br>
	<br>
	The Beavers and Cubs meet at St Faiths Parish hall and the Scouts meet at Badger Farm Community Centre.  All sections meet on Tuesdays.  We aim to run fun and adventurous activities across all age groups and hold whole Group activities and camps on occasion as well as joining in with District activities.<br>
	<br>
	As a relatively small Group we rely on most of our parents helping out in some capacity.  New leaders are always welcome but if that’s not your thing then there are plenty of other vital roles to keep the Group going.  Our philosophy is to spread the work amongst many volunteers in order to not overly impact on any person.<br>

	The Group is thriving and punches above its weight because of its high quality of Scouting.  The Scout Troop is a consistent performer at the annual District Antler Patrol and the Hampshire County Emlyn Patrol Competitions.  Five young people went to the World Scout Jamboree in the USA for 2019 - more than some counties!<br>
	<br>
	A second Scout Troop is a priority for 2020/21 to help 'Meet the Demand'. This is needed for young people to progress through the Scout programme for 6-18 year olds. There are 1,166 of them in the St Luke Ward.<br>
	<br>
	Stanmore Scouts own their hut with a 99 year lease with 40 years to run.  However, to fulfill its potential to 'Meet the Demand' from many more young people, a more suitable site is needed for a <a href="https://m.box.com/shared_item/https%3A%2F%2Fapp.box.com%2Fs%2Fpum9n8fu7w3ww6pxoapmbkni5uto4cmp" target="_blank">modern and large Scout building</a> for the next 80-100 years. Community use of the building would allow for many clubs and meeting groups for all ages. There are 3 options; a larger site in Somers Close; a site somewhere else in Stanmore; or a move outside Stanmore.<br>

	There has been Scouting for over 85 years in our Village. For over 20 of those years the group has been known as the 9th Winchester, and for over 15 years they have enjoyed having the addition of Beaver Scouts. The Group now covers the villages of Twyford
	and Owslebury.<br>
	<br>
	We are actively seeking a place to build a new headquarters to provide both scouting opportunities and use by the local community. A lot of hard work has already taken place on behalf of the group and we are confident that it will not be long before we are able to realise our dream to have a home of our own.<br>
	<br>
	We have a white marquee (6 X 9m - internal / 8 X 11m external) which is available for hire by members of the village and other organisations and we will happily talk to you about how to go about making use of the "big white tent", together with arrangements for putting it up, taking it down and of course a donation for its use, to help the group grow. Please contact <a target="_blank" class="Alink" href="mailto:9thWinchester@googlegroups.com">9thWinchester@googlegroups.com</a> to find out more about us, get our section timings and locations, or to book our marquee.<br>

	The opening of two new half Beaver Colonies at the 10th (each adding 4 x just 6 year olds at the beginning of every school term) will relieve the ‘waiting list’ pressure on neighbouring Scout Groups. These draw mainly on Western Primary and Westgate Lower School with their combined year cohorts of 120. Following new housing and new schools in the St Paul's ward, the local demand for Beaver places is so strong that the 10th is reforming. For its first year, the 10th Winchester (St Pauls) will be a satellite of the neighbouring 6th Winchester (Abbotts Barton).<br>
	<br>
	The 10th Winchester dates from Winchester's 1921 reorganisation and renumbering of Scout Groups. The 10th Winchester ran from 1921–1946 and again from 1951 to 1972 with its distinctive plain red necker. It was known as the St Thomas' Group and latterly as the St Thomas' and St Michael's Group. The 10th ceased to exist in 1972 when it merged with the 7th to form the current 8th Winchester.<br>
	<br>
	We are all volunteers with busy lives. But we give up valuable time to ensure great experiences for our children. No matter how busy you think you are, we need every parent to volunteer in some capacity. Everyone must participate and contribute to our community. You can find our roles – both uniform, non-uniform and support by clicking on the green ADULT LEADER TEAMS icon opposite. With so many of us involved – every other week or once a month - many hands make light work. This is how we achieve an enriching, fun and adventurous programme.<br>

	The group has a long history of scouting serving the local community to the north of the city centre.<br>
	<br>
	The current headquarters is constructed entirely from logs and is known as the Log Cabin. It has been well maintained over the years and has been extended and modernised to keep pace with legislation and provide a safe environment for both the youngsters and leaders who meet there.<br>
	<br>
	All the sections are thriving with enthusiastic leaders who provide an exciting and challenging programme of activities and events. They all support district events and take the opportunity to give the youngsters opportunities to get out and about as often as possible, as well as having meetings in the headquarters.<br>
	<br>
	We welcome enquires from adults looking to take on a leadership role or support the group in some other way.<br>

	The 12th is a thriving and growing Scout Group.  There are plans for second Beaver, Cub and Scout sections.  It also hosts the Paladin District Explorer Unit.  This makes it easy for moving on from Scouts to Explorers at the 14 year point.  All sections are for girls and boys. Traditional scouting combines with modern ideas to produce a balanced programme. This provides young people with fun, with challenging and adventurous activities, and the opportunity to make new friends.  Weekend camps over the year are an important part of life at the 12th.<br>
	<br>
	The Group was established in 1921 and has a long and illustrious history.  The 12th take their name from the local Green Jackets Regiment.  This was for organising POW food parcels after Dunkirk in 1940.  The Group is fortunate to have a large activity hall and an upstairs room that houses its archives. There is also a well-equipped kitchen and a toilet facility with wheelchair access.<br>
	<br>
	We hold an annual joint summer camp for Cubs and Scouts, sometimes in Eire and Guernsey. These camps incorporate activities like climbing, caving, canoeing, hill walking and hiking.  The Scout Troop also holds a traditional Christmas Camp, with a three-course meal cooked in a mud oven with a traditional campfire.  Come and try us out!  Every parent must help in some way.<br>

	The 13th has a long and illustrious history that dates back to 1922.  At that time it was started by 'Monty' Middleton.  This was just in time for the second Hengistbury Camp, one of the two 'Biggest ever' Winchester Scout Camps.<br>
	<br>
	The need for the 13th’s rebirth as 1 of 2 Scout Groups for Kings Barton was recognised as far back as 2013. This was evidenced in a paper <a href="/groups/documents/BartonFarmDemographicsYoung%20People16July2013.pdf" target="_blank">about demographics at Barton Farm</a>. <a href="http://www.hampshirechronicle.co.uk/news/10563581.Scouts_in_plea_for_more_Barton_Farm_facilities/" target="_blank">These arguments were accepted by Winchester City Council and CALA Homes.</a><br>

	Discussions are underway for the long lease of a suitable plot of land.  This is for a new Scout building that will also be for community use.  This could be similar to the 6th Winchester (Abbotts Barton & Hyde) <a href="https://m.box.com/shared_item/https%3A%2F%2Fapp.box.com%2Fs%2Fpum9n8fu7w3ww6pxoapmbkni5uto4cmp" target="_blank">£750k project in Hillier Way</a>.<br>
	<br>
	The long-term plan is for 2 Beaver Colonies, 2 Cub Packs, 2 Scout Troops & 2 Explorer Units.  This provides for some 200 young people aged 6-18 overseen by over 60 adult leader volunteers.<br>

	The backbone of the Group is our growing team of enthusiastic leaders.  It is they who provide an exciting and challenging programme of activities and events that attracts and retains our young people.  This ranges from knot tying and fire-lighting to nature hikes and geocaching, archery, camping and trips to Brownsea Island.  As adults we have as much fun as the young people do!  We always need more parent assistant leaders!<br>
	<br>
	As important is our growing non-uniform Executive Committee that supports the Group by providing governance, finance, and administration.  With our seed funds at bank and looking out, we need to find a plot of land for our own grounds and HQ at the heart of our community.

	The 13th has a long and illustrious history that dates back to 1922.  At that time it was started by 'Monty' Middleton.  This was just in time for the second Hengistbury Camp, one of the two 'Biggest ever' Winchester Scout Camps.<br>
	<br>
	The need for the 13th’s rebirth as 1 of 2 Scout Groups for Kings Barton was recognised as far back as 2013. This was evidenced in a paper <a href="/groups/documents/BartonFarmDemographicsYoung%20People16July2013.pdf" target="_blank">about demographics at Barton Farm</a>. <a href="http://www.hampshirechronicle.co.uk/news/10563581.Scouts_in_plea_for_more_Barton_Farm_facilities/" target="_blank">These arguments were accepted by Winchester City Council and CALA Homes.</a><br>

	The Wintonians Scout Network is for Scout Members aged 18-25 years. We are a thriving section but our numbers vary from week to week. Some of our members are former Winchester District Explorers who are now away at University and only in Winchester during vacations. Others are here at Winchester University and so only around term times. We meet on most Thursday evenings and attend national camps in the Spring and Summer.<br>
	<br>
	Network is best described as socialising with a purpose; we all share a love of Scouting and this is the way we stay connected. In our annual census we register about 25 members, some who take part regularly, others when they can. Apart from all the normal Scouting adventurous activities and opportunities to help out as Section Assistants or Assistant Leaders in the Scout Groups, we are also well organised and supported to complete your DofE Gold and The Queen's Scout Award. A few of us have got our Queen's Scout Award and proudly worn Lord Louis Mountbatten's silver elephant around our necks. And there are more of us in the pipeline!<br>
	<br>
	So whether you are just here term time; just here holidays; or are around all the time do get in touch and come along. It is a section that doesn't cost to join and you will be able to get involved in many fantastic activities at your leisure. <br>
	<br>
	Find out more about Network at a Hampshire level by following <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/scoutnetworkhampshire/" target="_blank">this link to the Facebook group of the Hampshire Scout Network (18-25 Scout section)</a>*. This will allow you to see upcoming events hosted by other groups in and around Hampshire. People also post about camps and upcoming opportunities in Scouting to complete awards etc. As a county we often go away camping several times a year and it would be great to have you along.<br>
